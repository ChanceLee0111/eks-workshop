      <description>The official Kubernetes dashboard is not deployed by default, but there are instructions in the official documentation
We can deploy the dashboard with the following command:
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml  Since this is deployed to our private cluster, we need to access it via a proxy. Kube-proxy is available to proxy our requests to the dashboard service. In your workspace, run the following command:
kubectl proxy --port=8080 --address=&#39;0.0.0.0&#39; --disable-filter=true &amp;amp;  This will start the proxy, listen on port 8080, listen on all interfaces, and will disable the filtering of non-localhost requests.</description>
